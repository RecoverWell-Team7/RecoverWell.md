### 📝 Summary
We created RecoverWell, a platform to support individuals recovering from substance abuse. It provides a nurturing community where people can connect, share experiences, and find the strength to overcome addiction. This app is important to us because each of us know someone that struggles with substance abuse

Substance abuse was already a significant issue in New York, especially in New York City, with high rates of overdose deaths. The pandemic worsened the problem due to increased stress, job losses, and social isolation. Our app addresses this need by offering a supportive community to encourage sobriety.
